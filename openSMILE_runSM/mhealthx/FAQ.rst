    1. Why mhealthx?
    2. Why Apache License?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_`Why mhealthx?`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of mhealthx is to create a uniform framework to extract features
from a variety of different sensor data sources, particularly suited to
mobile health research,
and to promote open science by making all software and documentation
freely and openly available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_`Why Apache License?`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have chosen the Apache v2.0 license because it is liberal and
supports broad use and modification of the software.
The Apache license allows other projects with virtually any license,
including GPL, to use our code, and makes it more likely that we will
attract support from companies, including open-source software
companies, such as `Continuum Analytics`_, Enthought_, and Kitware_.
