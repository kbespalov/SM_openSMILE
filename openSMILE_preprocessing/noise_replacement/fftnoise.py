Here (`http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32111-fftnoise-
generate-noise-with-a-specified-power-spectrum')you find matlab code from Aslak
Grinsted, creating noise with a specified power spectrum. It can easily be
ported to python:
"""
def fftnoise(f):
    f = np.array(f, dtype='complex')
    Np = (len(f) - 1) // 2
    phases = np.random.rand(Np) * 2 * np.pi
    phases = np.cos(phases) + 1j * np.sin(phases)
    f[1:Np+1] *= phases
    f[-1:-1-Np:-1] = np.conj(f[1:Np+1])
    return np.fft.ifft(f).real
"""
You can use it for your case like this:
"""
def band_limited_noise(min_freq, max_freq, samples=1024, samplerate=1):
    freqs = np.abs(np.fft.fftfreq(samples, 1/samplerate))
    f = np.zeros(samples)
    idx = np.where(np.logical_and(freqs>=min_freq, freqs<=max_freq))[0]
    f[idx] = 1
    return fftnoise(f)
"""
Seems to work as far as I see. For listening to your freshly created noise:
"""
from scipy.io import wavfile

x = band_limited_noise(200, 2000, 44100, 44100)
x = np.int16(x * (2**15 - 1))
wavfile.write("test.wav", 44100, x)
